# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Project Overview
In this project, we develope ETL and ML pipelines to analyze real messages that were sent during disaster events and build a model to categorize these events based on the massages. The devloped model can be used in future events to send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
### Project Components
There are three components you'll need to complete for this project.

#### 1. ETL Pipeline
In a Python script, process_data.py, write a data cleaning pipeline that:

Loads the messages and categories datasets
Merges the two datasets
Cleans the data
Stores it in a SQLite database
#### 2. ML Pipeline
In a Python script, train_classifier.py, write a machine learning pipeline that:

Loads data from the SQLite database
Splits the dataset into training and test sets
Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
Outputs results on the test set
Exports the final model as a pickle file
### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/disaster_response_db.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/disaster_response_db.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
